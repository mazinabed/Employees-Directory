# React-Employee-Directory
This assignment focused upon taking data from an API and processing it with filtering and sorting displaying it to the user. Instead of using pop drilling I decided to use reacts content providing state to components without using class components.

The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category which is name.

  * Filter the users by at least one property which is also their name.
